      "message": "I don\u0027t see why this was changed to include ResultSetMetadata instead of forward declare it. You could include ResultSetMetadata in columnar_result_set.h instead.\n\nPrefer forward declares to includes when possible. Forward declares are less sensitive to change.\nIf you have a .cc and it includes a header that includes another header, that .cc will need to recompile if the indirectly included header changed. If you instead have the header forward-declare its reference, and the class definition changes, it is not necessary to rebuild the .cc.\n\nAlso, forward declares are more flexible since they allow for circular dependencies.",
