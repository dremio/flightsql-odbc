      "message": "I\u0027m not really clear why this is more lazy than what was happening before.\nHowever I do think this is on the right track as an optimization.\n\nHow about this -- change the virtual log() to take in a string lambda instead of a message. Then the implementation can choose whether to run the lambda.\n\nThen we can remove checkLogLevel(), since its implicit in log() whether logging should be done and if the lambda gets run.\n\nAlso, let\u0027s change the semantics such that if logging is off, the global logger is just set to nullptr so we can just check if GetInstance() is null... that\u0027s quicker than a virtual function call.",
