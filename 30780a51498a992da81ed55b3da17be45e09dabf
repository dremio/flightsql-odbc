On Mac, let\u0027s create a small helper class EncodingResolver that has an inline accessor the SqlWCharSize. If it\u0027s zero, it should call a private function defined in a .cc to detect it/get from the environment variable.\n\nThat private static function can use the anonymous namespace since it\u0027s in a .cc and won\u0027t get cloned everywhere.",
